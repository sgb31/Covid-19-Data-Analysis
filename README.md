This project analyzes COVID-19 data in the United States using visualizations to track trends in new cases, deaths, and vaccination rates over time.
It employs various plots, including line graphs and bar charts, to illustrate the relationship between COVID-19 metrics and vaccination progress, as well as state-level comparisons of total cases and deaths.
The final dataset is saved for further analysis and reference.
